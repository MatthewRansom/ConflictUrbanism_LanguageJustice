# Rasters and Historical Maps with QGIS - Part II

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to mapping using rasters. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Find and use georeferenced historical maps for use as basemaps.
* Calculate the difference in population density between two raster layers. 
* Create a measure linguistic diversity through population density.


## Getting Started
Download the GitHub repository for the tutorials. Using the green button [here](https://github.com/michellejm/ConflictUrbanism_LanguageJustice), select `Download ZIP`. You only need to do this once (so if you did this for QGIS I, you do not need to do it again). The Data folder will then have all of the datasets needed for this tutorial. 

## Background
Raster data is primarily used in 3 ways. 
* Basemaps (i.e., a georeferenced historical map with contemporary infomation overlaid)
* Surface maps (i.e., population density, rainfall, or temperature)
* Thematic maps (i.e., land use maps)

Raster data is essentially a matrix of cells with a given value. In the case of images, this is just the pixels that make up the image. In the case of a population
