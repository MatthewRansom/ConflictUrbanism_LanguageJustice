# Tutorials for Conflict Urbanism: Language Justice 
##Spring 2017

Students in the class must take at least *four* tutorials, though everyone is welcome and encouraged to take more. A brief description follows. Everyone *must take Tutorial 5* as it introduces the Template for the final projects. 
* Students who are interested in a more technical approach to mapping should take, at a minimum, Tutorials 3, 4, 5, and 7 and optionally Tutorial 6, 8, or 9. 
* Students who are interested in using maps as a supplement to a project, or in digital storytelling should take Tutorials 1, 2 and 5 in addition to Tutorial 6, 8, or 9.

### Tutorials 1 & 2 Introduction to Mapping and Data with Carto 

Carto is a simple yet powerful tool for creating maps and analyzing spatial data. Students who are interested in Students will learn how to work with shapefiles, latitude/longitude, join datasets, filter by features, add layers, and embed their map into a website. Carto's low learning curve and WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) approach to mapping will allow students to get started on a mapping project almost immediately. Carto is also a great tool for geo-storytelling as well as students can drop pins, insert images, and customize their map to add texture and dimension to their final product. The spatial calculations allowed by Carto are limited, and students must choose one of the pre-made themes to display their data.  
	
### Tutorials 3 & 4 Introduction to Mapping and Data with QGIS 

QGIS is a very powerful program to analyze, edit, and display geographic information. Students who are interested in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and wish to develop skills in spatial analysis and cartography will benefit from this series. Students will learn how to upload and join datasets, why Coordinate Reference Systems matter, how to join features based on location, create buffers and perform analyses on the features within boundaries, how layers work together, and how to export maps.
	
### Tutorial 5 Introduction to HTML & CSS - The CU: LJ Template

This tutorial is required for ALL students in the course as it introduces the template students will need to use to create their final projects. Through this tutorial, students will also develop familiarity with the languages used to structure and style websites: HTML and CSS.
	
### Tutorial 6 Finding and Cleaning Data

This tutorial introduces students to places to go to find data and how to use Excel to clean a dataset and prepare it for use in mapping or GIS software programs. This tutorial will be especially beneficial to students who will use demographic or statistical data about their neighborhood regardless of which mapping platform they choose.
	
### Tutorial 7 Styling Maps with QGIS and Leaflet.js 

This tutorial introduces Leaflet.js Leaflet can be used with QGIS, Carto, and Open Street Map.  Leaflet.js is used to style maps, make them interactive, and take a static map into a web map. In this tutorial, we will go through an example using QGIS therefore, this tutorial is aimed at students who took the QGIS series. However, students who did not take the QGIS tutorials will be able to take this tutorial using a pre-made sample project.
	
### Tutorial 8 Visualizing Space beyond the Map: Photography and Photoshop

In this tutorial, students will be introduced to a variety of basic techniques for taking visually interesting photographs, including angle and perspective, lighting, and composition. Images can be taken with a cameraphone. Students will then edit photos using Photoshop. This is an introductory level workshop for those with no experience in photography or image editing. 
	
### Tutorial 9: Visualizing Space Beyond the Map: Data Visualization

In this tutorial, students will be exposed to a wide variety of visualization types, and alternative ways to think about spatial information and how it intersects with other dimensions of the city - social, digital, structural, etc.
